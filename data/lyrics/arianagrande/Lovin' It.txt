It's The Rascals!
Baby, don't you know you've got all my love, all my love?
Baby, don't you know you've got all my love, all my love?

Hold up, wait
Before you go, just stay
And talk to me for a little
Baby, won't you loosen up just a little, eh?

See, what you don't understand
Is fallin' in love wasn't part of my plan
Started with a crush, now I call you my man
Doubt that I'll ever fall in love, ever fall in love again
'Cause you give me chills every time we chill
I spend all of my days doin', doin'

Nothin' but lovin' you
Nothin' but lovin' you, baby
Boy, you got all my time
I'm lovin' your lovin'
I'm lovin', I'm lovin' it, baby
Boy you got all my, all my love and affection, all my attention
You don't gotta question if I'm really lovin' your lovin'
I'm lovin', I'm lovin' it, baby
Boy, you got all my, all my

Hold up, wait
Shut up and kiss me, babe
I just wanna get a little taste
I just wanna get a little taste before you go

See, what you don't understand
Is fallin' in love wasn't part of my plan
Started with a crush, now I call you my man
Doubt that I'll ever fall in love, ever fall in love again
'Cause you give me chills every time we chill
I spend all of my days doin', doin'

Nothin' but lovin' you
Nothin' but lovin' you, baby
Boy, you got all my time
I'm lovin' your lovin'
I'm lovin', I'm lovin' it, baby
Boy you got all my, all my love and affection, all my attention
You don't gotta question if I'm really lovin' your lovin'
I'm lovin', I'm lovin' it, baby
Boy, you got all my, all my

Time and my trust
Don't mess this up
You got me fallin' in love
You got me fallin' in love
You got me fallin' so hard
Boy, you change the way I breathe
When you put your lips on me
I adore you
So let me make it clear to you
That boy, you're all I need
My baby

Nothin' but lovin' you
Nothin' but lovin' you, baby
Boy, you got all my time (Baby)
I'm lovin' your lovin'
I'm lovin', I'm lovin' it, baby
Boy, you got all my, all my love and affection, all my attention
You don't gotta question if I'm really lovin' your lovin'
