[Ariana Grande:]
You walked in
Caught my attention
I've never seen
A man with so much dimension

It's the way you walk, the way you talk
The way you make me feel inside
It's in your smile, it's in your eyes
I don't wanna wait for tonight

So I'm daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you
And only you
Got me daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you
And only you

Fo—For you (Oh, oh, oh)
For you (Oh, oh, oh)
For you (Oh, oh, oh)
For you (Oh, oh)

Now I can't wait
To hold you in my arms
I know I was made for you
I'm in love with all your charm

It's the way you walk, the way you talk
The way you make me feel inside
It's in your smile, it's in your eyes
I don't wanna wait for tonight

So I'm daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you
And only you
Got me daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you
And only you

Oh, I want ya
Gotta have ya
And I need you
Like I've never had lovin' before
Oh, I want ya
Ou, I need you
Gotta have ya
Like I've never had lovin' before

So I'm daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you
And only you
Got me daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you
And only you

Fo—For you (Oh, oh, oh)
For you (Oh, oh, oh)
For you (Oh, oh, oh)
For you (Oh, oh)

He was a man's man and a ladies' man
(18, 19, I began to become more serious about things in life)
Oh, I think when I was standing on that stoop and I looked at him, yeah, I was 11 years old
