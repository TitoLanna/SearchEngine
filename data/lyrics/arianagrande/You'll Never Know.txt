Now you finally tell me how you feel
Guess your words just came a little too late
All the drama, boy, it's overkill
Don't get mad at me 'cause you've been replaced
Know your place

But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt, then maybe it'd be different
If you spoke, I would've listened
But now, I'm with somebody else, and he loves me
Too much for me to mess this up
But it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering where this thing could go

But you will never know (Oh-oh)
What we could have been
If you would've shown (Oh-oh)
Your way back then
Boy, you gotta (Yup, yup)
Boy, you shoulda (Yup, yup)
'Cause you didn't, no, so
Now you'll never know, you'll never know

Now it's probably hard for you to hear
But there's nothing left for you to say
Had my heart all in your hands, boy, what you don't understand
Is a girl like me don't have no time to waste around

But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt, then maybe it'd be different
If you spoke, I would've listened
But now, I'm with somebody else, and he loves me
Too much for me to mess this up
But it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering where this thing could go

But you will never know (Oh-oh)
What we could have been
If you would've shown (If you would've shown) (Oh-oh)
Your way back then
Boy, you gotta (Yup, yup)
Boy, you shoulda (Yup, yup)
'Cause you didn't know, so
Now you'll never know, you'll never know

You'll never know
Boy, you should've told me, told me
You'll never know
Boy, you should've let me know
You'll never know
Boy, you could've been there for me
But now you'll never know, you'll never know

It's not my fault
You're a little bit too late
You're the only one to blame
Wipe that look off your face
You can wish a thousand times
But none of that will change my mind, boy
You had a chance you'll never get back, get back, uh-uh

You will never know what we could have been
If you would've shown (If you would've shown, babe)
Your way back then (Way back then, baby)
Boy, you gotta (Yup, yup)
Boy, you shoulda (Yup, yup)
'Cause you didn't know, so
Now you'll never know (Oh, baby)

You'll never know
Boy, you should've told me, told me
You'll never know
Boy, you should've let me know
You'll never know
Boy, you could've been there for me
But now you'll never know, you'll never know
You'll never know (You will never know, you will never know)
You'll never know (No)
You'll never know (You will never know)
