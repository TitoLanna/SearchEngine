You see the world in black and white
No colour or light
You think you'll never get it right
But you're wrong, you might
The sky could fall, could fall on me
The parting of the seas
But you mean more, mean more to me
Than any colour I can see

All you ever wanted was love, but you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give itself up
All you ever wanted to be, living in perfect symmetry
Nothing is as down or up as us, as us

You see the world in black and white
Not painted right
You see no meaning to your life
You should try
You should try

And all you ever wanted was love, but you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give itself up
And all you ever wanted to be, living in perfect symmetry
Nothing is as down or up as us

And don't you wanna see it come soon, floating in a big white balloon
Or given on your own silver spoon?
Don't you wanna see it come down, there for throwing your arms around
And say "You're not a moment too soon"?

'Cause I feel low
'Cause I feel low, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, I feel low, oh no
Oh
Oh, 'cause I feel low
'Cause I feel low, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
But I feel low, oh no
Oh
