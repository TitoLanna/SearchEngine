Come on now, don't you want to see
This thing that's happening to me
Like Moses has power over sea
So you've got a power over me

Come on now, don't you want to know
That you're a refuge, somewhere I can go
And you're air that, air that I can breathe
You're my golden opportunity

And oh, oh yes I would
If I only could
And you know I would
And baby I, oh baby I
I wish

Come on now, don't you want to see
Just what a difference you've made to me
I'll be waiting no matter what you say
And I'll keep waiting for days and days and days

And oh, oh yes I would
If I only could
And you know I would
And baby I, oh baby I
I wish

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
If the sky's gonna fall down let it fall on me
If you're gonna break down you can break on me
If the sky's gonna fall down let it fall on me
Oh Lord, let it fall on me
