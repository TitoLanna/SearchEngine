Could you, could you come back?
Come back together
Put yourself on my back
And say it's forever
Could you, could you come home?
Come home forever
Your shoulders, knees and your back
Will keep us together

'Cause you're the one I love
You're the one I love
You're the one I love
Ah, ah

Could you, could you come on?
Could you tell me whatever?
Tie yourself to a mast?
It's now or it's never
Gonna tear us apart
Tell me forever
It's gonna tear us apart
Keep us together

You're the one I love
You're the one I love
Ah, ah
You're the one I love
(Yeah, yeah, you're the one)

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

(You're the one I love)
(You're the one I love)
(You're the one I love)
