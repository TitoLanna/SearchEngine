Sunlight opened up my eyes
To see for the first time, it opened them up
And tonight rivers will run dry
Not for the first time, rivers will run

Hundreds of years in the future
There could be computers looking for life on Earth
Don't fight for the wrong side, say what you feel like
Say how you feel

You go backwards, but then
You go forwards again
You go backwards, but then
You go

Created, then drilled and invaded
If somebody made it, someone will mess it up
And you are not wrong to ask, "Who does this belong to?"
It belongs to all of us

You go backwards, but then
You go forwards again
You go backwards, but then
You go forwards
You go backwards, but then
You go forwards again
You go backwards, but then
You go forwards
